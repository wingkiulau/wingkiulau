                <p> 2D multiplayer claw machine game developed using C# on Unity during a 48 hour game jam. One player controls a teddy bear attempting to retrieve its lost button eye using the claw, while the other player controls the button evading capture.
                    My primary responsibilities included developing the button mechanics, integrating sound effects, and designing the stuffed toys.</p>

            <p> 2D platformer game developed using C# on Unity. The player controls a frog character by jumping on spinning lily pads to a portal within a time limit, navigating increasingly challenging obstacles including increasingly lily pad speed and moving portals.
                I was primarily responsible for the design of the frog, where I used Photoshop to 
                create the frog sprite sheet and coded the frog mechanics. I also worked on the scene management and timer,
                the sound effects on Audacity, and some UI scenes.
